This project was carried out under the supervision of Dr. Carlos Martorell at Facultad
de Ciencias, Universidad Nacional Aut\'onoma de M\'exico. 

Keywords: High-altitude communities; Nurse plant; Interspecific interactions; Stress amelioration; Thermal buffering

## Motivation

Páramos (high-altitude tropical environments) pose a suite of stressful factors that affect 
plants. Furthermore, these stressors are likely to increase in intensity as a result
of climate change. Thus, understanding how plants cope with stressors can provide insights
into .interacting species cope with a multitude of stressors 
Tussocky grasses may improve soil properties, ameliorate extreme temperatures, and 
mitigate UV radiation, thus facilitating neighbouring plants. 
Which stress-amelioration 
mechanisms actually result in facilitation by tussocks, and what is their relative importance?


## Research Strategy

In a field experiment we manipulated five different stressors: Low temperatures, high temperatures, 
UV radiation, and lack of soil nutrients and water.  We analysed their individual effect on the 
performance (survival and growth) of a plant species that usually grows under tussocks. 


## Main findings

Most of the treatments improved the protégé species’ survival, though amelioration of 
extreme temperatures had the largest positive effects. Nevertheless, no treatment was as 
effective as growing under a tussock. Tussocks had some negative effects on the growth of 
the associated species, seemingly through modification of soil properties.


Facilitation is the result of the simultaneous amelioration of multiple stressors, with the 
regulation of extreme temperatures being the most important factor. The observed negative 
effects are consistent with observations of strong competition between plants and soil 
microorganisms, which are favoured by tussocks. Our findings suggest that the interplay 
between the effects of benefactor plants on particular stressors, and the stress-tolerance 
of different associated species, determine the dynamics of the plant-plant interaction, 
perhaps explaining why facilitative interactions are highly species-specific.
