This project was carried out under the supervision of Dr. Timothy Barraclough at Silwood Park,
Imperial College London as part of my masters degree. 

Keywords: Biodiversity; Functional Redundancy; Gut Microbiota; Interactions; Perturbation; Stability

## Motivation

The adequate functioning of the microbiota across variable environmental conditions is of 
vital importance for human health. Alterations to microbiota composition and functioning
have been found to occur in all types of diseases from irritable bowel syndrome to cancer. 
Therefore, there is a large interest in designing communities with optimized function and stability. 
Yet, there is a lack of understanding of the ecological processes that shape the microbiota 
and dictate its sensitivity to perturbations. 

## Research Strategy

Microbiota community dynamics were simulated using a chemostat-based, differential equation 
model, that included the main bacterial functional groups that inhabit the human gut. 
Communities were simulated to test the role of diversity, functional redundancy and resource 
exploitation strategies on ecological and functional resilience to changes in diet.

## Main findings

Overall community diversity did not seem to increase community resilience to changes in 
diet. Instead, functional redundancy tened to increase ecological and functional displacements
as a result of perturbations. Furthermore, specialist exploitation strategies buffered 
perturbation effects at both the species and community level. These results highlight the
importance of functional diversity on microbiota sensitivity to changes in diet.
