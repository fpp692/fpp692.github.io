This project was carried out under the supervision of Dr. Carlos Martorell at Facultad
de Ciencias, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México as part of my undergraduate degree.

Keywords: C-S-R theory; disturbance tolerance; functional attributes; Grime’s triangle; hydric stress tolerance; three primary-strategies theory

## Motivation

One of the classic ecological theories is that of the three primary vegetation strategies proposed
by Grime. The theory identifies stress and disturbance as the key environmental factors that led to
the emergence of distinct plant strategies. Each strategy is defined by a combination of stress and disturbance tolerance.
Ecologists have long sought to determine the position of plant species in the strategy space. Traditionally, sets of attributes
have been used to infer strategies. However, due to circular reasoning and inherent restrictions
to species’ distribution in strategy space, these approaches may be hindering our ability to
correctly position species in strategy space. To address this, we proposed a new allocation method
based on the measurement of stress, disturbance and plant abundance.

## Research Strategy

We quantified stress and disturbance conditions from permanent quadrats located in a semiarid
grassland in the Mixteca region in Oaxaca, Mexico. We also registered plant abundances for
50 species at the study site. We then used statistical models to infer stress and disturbance
tolerance for each studies species. Finally, we correlated the functional attributes of these
species with their tolerance.

## Main findings

Most species were allocated towards high disturbance intensities, possibly due to the rich
history of grazing at the study site. On the other hand, most species were allocated toward
low stress intensities. In terms of attributes, most results were in line with the trends
expected by the theory, suggesting that our measurements reflect the basic principles proposed
by Grime. We show that species can be positioned in strategy space by measuring stress and
disturbance, and that these positions correspond with environmental and species characteristics.
