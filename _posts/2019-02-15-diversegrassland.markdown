I was part of the team that searched for experimental quadrats that had a high species richness
in the Mixteca region of Oaxaca, Mexico. This project was carried out under the
supervision of Dr. Martorell and with contributions from V. Zepeda, A. Martínez-Blancas
and D. García-Meza.

## Motivation

Diversity records have been recorded in both tropical rain forests and in grasslands.
Furthermore, for grasslands, evidence suggests that chronic disturbance can in fact
increase diversity. We aimed to test the prediction that disturbances has a positive
effect on species richness and to determine whether our study site may in fact be holder of
a world record in diversity.

## Research Strategy

We recorded species richness in 0.1 x 0.1 m randomly sampled quadrats at 21 sites.
We also measured chronic disturbance at the study sites. Then, using maximum likelihood
analyses, we estimated the maximum species richness at each site and correlated it with
its disturbance measurements. At one particular site we then searched for high richness
quadrats.  

## Main findings

Our study site shares the current world record in species richness at the scale of
0.1 x 0.1 m with 25 species. We also found that estimated maximum diversity at the sites
declined with land degradation, but reach a maximum at intermediate to high levels of livestock
activity.
