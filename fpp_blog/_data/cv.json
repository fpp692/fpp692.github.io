    "summary": "I am a Biologist by training who is interested in integrating computational, statistical and mathematical methods to address fundamental questions in Ecology. In past projects I have studied the effects of abiotic stressors on grassland plant species, the mechanisms underpinning plant facilitation in high-altitude environments and the effect of diversity on stability of the microbiota. I am currently in the process of defining my PhD project, which will revolve around evolution in mutualistic networks. ",
