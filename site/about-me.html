My name is Fernando Pedraza Pérez, welcome to my site. I am a biologist interested in using computational
and mathematical tools to address fundamental questions in Ecology and Evolution. I am also an avid
fan of cinema, photography enthusiast and an aspiring computer programer. This space acts as a central 
node to connect my various interests within science and beyond.
