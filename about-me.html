I am a PhD student in Ecology currently based in Switzerland. I am interested in understanding how species
interactions can drive the evolution of species in communitites. To do this, I build and use mathematical and computational tools.
Outside of science, my hobbies include music, film, photography and learning computing skills.

<p>
I've built this site to connect and comunicate my various interests in science and beyond.
You will find brief summaries of previous scientific projects I have been involved in, photographs I have taken
over the years and posts on whaterver else I find interesting.
